X Make an app that can show a block on a really large block (conveyor)
X Resize the conveyor to be 100 meters long and 1 meter wide, stretching away from the camera.
X Adjust the camera so that the block appears to be a meter or so below the camera while the camera is staring down
X Resize the block so that it is 2"x4"x10"
X Enable physics for said block so that it falls and settles to the conveyor
# Move the conveyor so that it carries the block with it.
# Enable spawning of new blocks upstream of the camera view
# Fix conveyor sliding
# Enable the spawnned blocks to be in random orientation
# enable block to block collisions.
# Add a stationary object for manipulation (finger)
# Enable block to finger collisions
# enable finger movement
# Cause the finger to move with the keyboard
# Add a scoreboard value that prints to the console
# Sense when the blocks leave the camera view
	# Delete the block
	# Decrement the score if too high
# Sense when the conveyor end is almost to the camera view
	# Teleport the conveyor to the starting position
# Add reward zone for correcting blocks
